# Spring Framework 🌱

Spring is a **lightweight Java framework** used to build scalable and
maintainable enterprise applications.

It focuses on **loose coupling** and **dependency management**.

---

## ❓ Why Spring?
- Loose coupling
- Easy testing
- Modular architecture
- Enterprise-level support

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🔹 IOC (Inversion of Control)
Spring controls object creation instead of the programmer.

### 🔹 Dependency Injection (DI)
Objects are injected automatically rather than created manually.

---

## 🧱 Spring Containers
- BeanFactory
- ApplicationContext

---

## 📄 Configuration Types
- XML-based configuration
- Annotation-based configuration
- Java-based configuration

(Currently learning XML-based)

---

## 🫘 Spring Beans
- Bean definition
- Bean scope
- Bean lifecycle
- Getter & Setter injection

---

## 🔄 Spring Flow
1. Create POJO class
2. Define beans in XML
3. Load Spring container
4. Get bean object
5. Use object methods

---

## 📌 Advantages
- Clean architecture
- Easy maintenance
- Better code reuse
- Supports other frameworks
