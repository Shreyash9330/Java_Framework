# Spring Framework 🌱

Spring is a lightweight Java framework used to build
**loosely coupled, maintainable, and scalable applications**.

It manages object creation and dependency management.

---

## ❓ Why Spring?
- Loose coupling
- Better code maintainability
- Easy testing
- Modular architecture

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Inversion of Control (IOC)
Spring controls object creation instead of the programmer.

### 🔹 Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependencies are injected automatically rather than created manually.

---

## 🧱 Spring Containers
- BeanFactory
- ApplicationContext

---

## 🫘 Spring Beans
- Bean definition
- Setter Injection
- Bean lifecycle
- Bean scope

---

## 🔁 Spring Execution Flow
1. Create POJO class
2. Configure beans (XML)
3. Load Spring container
4. Retrieve bean object
5. Use business logic
