# 🌱 Spring Framework

Spring is a lightweight Java framework used to build **loosely coupled, maintainable, and scalable applications**.  
It manages object creation, dependency injection, bean lifecycle, and provides a powerful container for enterprise Java development.

This folder represents my complete journey of learning **Spring Core Framework** including dependency injection,
bean scopes, collections injection, inheritance, AOP, and JDBC template.

## ❓ Why Spring?

- Eliminates tight coupling  
- Improves code maintainability  
- Simplifies testing using DI  
- Supports modular & layered architecture  
- Provides ready-made enterprise features  

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Learned

### 🔹 Inversion of Control (IoC)
Spring container controls object creation instead of the programmer.

### 🔹 Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependencies are injected automatically instead of creating them manually.

- Constructor Injection  
- Setter Injection  
- Collection Injection  
- Map Injection

## 🧱 Spring Containers

- **BeanFactory** – Basic container  
- **ApplicationContext** – Advanced container with enterprise features  

---

## 🫘 Spring Beans

- Bean Definition  
- Bean Scope – Singleton, Prototype  
- Bean Lifecycle  
- Autowiring  

---

## 🏗 Modules Practiced in This Folder

- Constructor Injection  
- Setter Injection  
- JDBC Template  
- Spring AOP  
- Spring Inheritance  
- Collection Mapping

## 🔁 Spring Execution Flow

1. Create POJO class  
2. Configure beans using XML  
3. Load Spring container  
4. Retrieve bean objects  
5. Execute business logic
