# Java Framework Learning Repository 🚀

This repository represents my structured learning journey of **Java Frameworks**.
I am focusing on understanding frameworks from fundamentals to practical usage.

Currently covered frameworks:
- ✅ Hibernate (ORM Framework)
- 🔄 Spring Framework (Core)

Each framework is maintained in a **separate module with its own README**
to keep learning clean, modular, and professional.
